            <p>While working, yet another temp job, feeling underused and under valued, Angry Black Woman 101 was born.</p>
            <p>Angry Black Woman 101 is a solo show that takes an introductory dive into the microaggressions, tropes and misogynoir Black women deal with in the workplace and in society at large.</p>
            <p>This show is couched in a truthful and hurtful work situation during my tenure at TechSoup, a local nonprofit. My experience illustrates the concept of Black women suffering through microaggressions, being micromanaged, held under higher scrutiny at work. How their well being and safety is never a consideration. How white women’s tears are used to deflect and disenfranchise Black women.</p>
            <p>Interspersed throughout the show are vignettes, stories, poetry and media pieces to illustrate the topic of the crossroads of misogyny and racism that Black women have to navigate daily: at work, at school, on the street, at the market.</p>
            <p>I celebrate the tenacity of Black women, in spite of all. I rejoice in the knowledge that we still manage to survive and thrive as marginalized citizens in this society.</p>
